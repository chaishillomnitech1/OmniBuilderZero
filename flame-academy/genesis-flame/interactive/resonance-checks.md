# Resonance Checks

## Self-Assessment for Aligned Progress

Resonance Checks are self-assessment exercises that measure your alignment with course material, identify growth areas, and ensure you're ready to proceed. They combine knowledge verification with personal reflection.

## How Resonance Checks Work

### Purpose

1. **Verify Understanding**: Confirm you've grasped key concepts
2. **Identify Gaps**: Reveal areas needing more attention

4. **Track Growth**: Document your transformation over time

### Format

Each Resonance Check includes:
- **Knowledge Questions**: Test factual understanding
- **Application Questions**: Test ability to apply concepts
- **Reflection Questions**: Connect learning to personal journey

### Scoring

- **3.5/5 minimum** to proceed to next module

## Module 2 Resonance Check

### Knowledge Questions (2 points)

**Q1. What are the four layers of the ScrollVerse protocol stack?** (1 point)

*List the layers from bottom to top:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

1. Layer 1: Truth Protocols (How we trust)
2. Layer 2: Identity Protocols (How we verify)
3. Layer 3: Application Protocols (How we build)
4. Layer 4: Community Protocols (How we govern)

</details>

**Q2. What is the NŪR resonance score formula?** (1 point)

*Write the formula and explain each component:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Resonance Score = (Truth Alignment × Harmony Factor × Impact Potential) / Resistance Index

- Truth Alignment: How aligned with truth/authenticity
- Harmony Factor: Cultural and relational fit
- Impact Potential: Possible positive effect
- Resistance Index: Obstacles and friction

</details>

### Application Questions (2 points)

**Q3. Construct a Sacred Logic Gate for the following decision:** (1.5 points)

*"Should I spend 2 hours learning something new or completing a project?"*

*Write your If-Then-Else Gate:*

<details>
<summary>Evaluation Criteria</summary>

- Proper If-Then-Else structure
- Considers multiple conditions
- Includes resonance considerations
- Shows nested logic if appropriate

Example:
```
IF learning_urgency > project_deadline_urgency
   AND learning_aligns_with_goals == true
THEN
   prioritize_learning()
ELSE
   IF project_completion_value > learning_value
   THEN
      complete_project()
   ELSE
      allocate_time_to_both()
```

</details>

**Q4. Calculate a NŪR score for this scenario:** (0.5 points)

*A partnership opportunity: Truth Alignment = 8, Harmony Factor = 6, Impact Potential = 9, Resistance Index = 2*

*Show your calculation and interpret the result:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Score = (8 × 6 × 9) / 2 = 432 / 2 = 216

Note: This is a raw score. For a 1-10 scale, normalize appropriately.

On a simplified 1-10 scale where components average:
Score ≈ (8 + 6 + 9) / 3 × (1 - (2/10)) = 7.67 × 0.8 ≈ 6.1

Interpretation: Moderate resonance—worth exploring but needs calibration to address the harmony gap.

</details>

### Reflection Question (1 point)

**Q5. How has understanding Sacred Logic changed your approach to decision-making?** (1 point)

*Write your reflection (3-5 sentences):*

<details>
<summary>Evaluation Criteria</summary>

- Shows genuine reflection
- Connects to personal experience
- Demonstrates understanding of concepts
- Indicates practical application

</details>

## Module 3 Resonance Check

### Knowledge Questions (2 points)

**Q1. What distinguishes Web3 from Web2?** (0.5 points)

*Explain in one sentence:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Web3 adds ownership and sovereignty—users own their data, identity, and value—compared to Web2 where platforms own user data.

</details>

**Q2. What is the difference between ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs?** (0.5 points)

*Explain:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

- ERC-721: Each token is unique (non-fungible), one owner per token
- ERC-1155: Multi-token standard, can have multiple copies of the same token (semi-fungible), more efficient for editions

</details>

**Q3. What is a Layer 2 solution and why does ScrollVerse use Scroll?** (1 point)

*Explain:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Layer 2: A scaling solution built on top of Layer 1 (Ethereum) that processes transactions off the main chain while inheriting its security.

ScrollVerse uses Scroll because:
- Lower transaction costs (90%+ reduction)
- Faster confirmations
- Ethereum security inheritance
- zkEVM technology
- Naming/philosophical alignment

</details>

### Application Questions (2 points)

**Q4. Trace a blockchain transaction conceptually.** (1 point)

*Describe what happens from when a user clicks "send" to when the transaction is confirmed:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

1. User initiates transaction (clicks send)
2. Wallet creates and signs transaction
3. Transaction broadcast to network
4. Nodes validate and add to mempool
5. Block producer includes in block
6. Block validated and added to chain
7. Confirmation achieved
8. State updated across network

(Minimum 5 steps for full credit)

</details>

**Q5. How do smart contracts implement Sacred Logic?** (1 point)

*Provide an example:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Smart contracts use conditional statements (if/else) that mirror Sacred Logic Gates:

Example:
```solidity
function evaluatePartnership(bool truthAligned, uint score) {
    if (truthAligned && score >= 7) {
        // Proceed with partnership
        proceedWithPartnership();
    } else if (score >= 5) {
        // Require calibration
        emit CalibrationRequired();
    } else {
        // Decline
        revert("Resonance too low");
    }
}
```

The code enforces decision criteria automatically, trustlessly, and transparently.

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

1. Truth Alignment: 30%
2. Cultural Harmony: 25%
3. Strategic Synergy: 25%
4. Sustainability: 20%

</details>

### Application Question (2 points)

**Q5. How should you interpret resistance when you encounter it in decision-making?** (1 point)

*Explain with examples:*

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Resistance is information, not opposition:

- Internal resistance: May indicate ego involvement, fear of change, or misalignment with values. Examine assumptions.

- External resistance: May indicate timing issues, communication gaps, or genuine misalignment. Evaluate circumstances.

- Both together: Major recalibration needed—do not proceed until clarity emerges.

Example: Resistance to a partnership might indicate the partner isn't as aligned as initially appeared.

<details>
<summary>Expected Answer</summary>

Cultural intelligence ensures:

- Appropriate adaptation of approach without losing authenticity
- Prevention of misunderstandings and offense
- Building genuine cross-cultural relationships

Example: Understanding Japanese business protocols (patience, relationship-first) versus American directness prevents partnership failure.
